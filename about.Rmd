title: "About Me"
---

I am a Mastersâ€™ student in Urban Spatial Analytics at the University of Pennsylvania, a program that combines data science and statistics with a focus on urban issues. I am seeking to combine my liberal arts undergraduate experience with my STEM graduate studies to analyze large datasets and present those insight to help businesses make data-based decisions that align with their project goals. I am well-versed in R, PostgreSQL, C#, Javascript, HTML/CSS, and the ArcSuite. I am currently studying Java, and machine learning techniques with Keras and TensorFlow.
